# Specification for the project

## New possible features

### User authentication and authorization

Implementing user authentication and authorization is important for ensuring that only authorized users can access certain parts of the website, such as creating and editing movie reviews or leaving comments. Use a third-party authentication provider like Google or Facebook.

### Social media integration

Integrating social media features into the website can allow users to share their favorite movies, reviews, and comments with their friends on social media platforms. This can help drive traffic to the website and increase its visibility.

### Search functionality

Adding search functionality to the website can allow users to easily find specific movies or reviews they are looking for. Implement a search bar on the website that allows users to search by movie title, actor, genre, or other relevant keywords.

### Advanced filtering options

Implementing advanced filtering options can allow users to quickly sort through a large number of movies and reviews to find the ones that are most relevant to them. Add filters such as release date, rating, genre, language, or director.

### Recommendations and personalized content

Using machine learning algorithms and user data, it's possible to provide personalized movie recommendations to the users. This can help them discover new movies that they might not have otherwise found, and increase engagement with the website.

### Mobile optimization

Optimizing the website for mobile devices can ensure that users can access and use the website on their smartphones or tablets. This is especially important as more and more people use their mobile devices to browse the web.

### Multilingual support

Providing multilingual support can help attract users from different regions and improve the accessibility of the website to a wider audience. You can provide language options on the website and translate all relevant content.

### Payment integration

If you want to offer premium content such as movie rentals or purchases, integrating payment functionality into the website can allow users to easily make payments and access the content they want.

### Analytics and reporting

Using analytics tools, it is possible to track user behavior on the website and gain insights into how users interact with content. This can help you make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and increase engagement with the website.

## Fixes in the code
